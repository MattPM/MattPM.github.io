I am a MD-PhD student in the NIH Oxcam program currently working at the NIH intramural research campus under the mentorship of [John Tsang (NIAID)](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/john-tsang-phd). My PhD work in collaboration with [Ken Smith (Cambridge)](http://www.med.cam.ac.uk/smith/) focuses on linking human immune system variations meaningful clinical phenotypes in cancer, vaccination, and autoimmune diseases.  
  
Much of my current work focuses on statistical modeling high throughput immune system measurements, for example, transcriptome, proteome and single cell multi-omics data generated from human clinical cohorts. I'm use statistical models (mixed models and "machine learning") to integrate multimodal data at different biological scales as a means to understand the circuitry of immune system states. The goals of these approaches are both to answer basic research questions about human immune system variation and to inform biomarker development and therapeutic strategies in different clinical contexts.
