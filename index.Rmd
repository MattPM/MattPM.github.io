I'm an MD-PhD student in the NIH Oxcam program. 

My work with [John Tsang (NIAID)](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/john-tsang-phd) and [Ken Smith (Cambridge)](http://www.med.cam.ac.uk/smith/) focuses on defining multcellular phenotypes linked to meaninfgul clinical phenotypes in cancer, vaccination, and autoimmune disease. We develop formal analysis frameworks for analyzing high throughput immune system measurements, for example, transcriptome, proteome and multimodal single cell data generated from human clinical cohorts. My main approaches are using mixed effects models and various machine learning approaches to integrate multimodal data across different biological scales as a means to understand the circuitry of immune system states. The goals of these approaches are both to answer basic research questions about the wiring of the human immune system while informing biomarker development and therapeutic strategies in different clinical contexts.
